# ML_Final_Project

for_importing.py and Binning_to_import.py are files that clean and bin the data, as seen in Feature_selection_and_LR.ipynb and binning_ipynb (respectively), so that it doesn't have to be done in every file. LogReg8, SVC, DNN, and Neural_net_weighted are files that optimize their respective classification algorithms. The best models are copied into the ensemble.py file. The normalize.py file just has a function that normalizes percentages that are input into the GUI, so that the ensemble algorithm can apply.
